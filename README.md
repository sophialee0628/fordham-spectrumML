# fordham-spectrumML

This is a pedagogical lab project that I collaborated with Chemistry Department of Fordham University.
It covers data preprocessing, building machine learning models, testing, and result analysis
- libraries : pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, plotly, scipy, rdkit

## Objectives
- Gain proficiency in reading and modifying Python code in the Google Colab/Jupyter notebook environment
- Build machine learning binary classification models that predict the presence of a carbonyl group using IR spectroscopy data
- Learn about different machine learning classification models
- Learn how data preprocessing and analysis parameters affect the performance of machine learning models
